# Operating System Simulation (Phase 1 & Phase 2) | Java

## Overview

This project simulates a basic operating system using Java, providing insight into fundamental operating system concepts such as process management, memory management, error handling, and system calls. The project is divided into two phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Implements CPU and Machine Simulation.
2. **Phase 2**: Adds Supervisor Call handling, Paging, Error Handling, and Interrupt generation.

By the end of this project, key operating system functions like scheduling, memory management, and interrupt handling have been simulated in a Java-based environment.

## Key Features

### **1. CPU/Machine Simulation:**
- Simulates the behavior of a CPU, process scheduling, and resource allocation.
  
### **2. Supervisor Call (Syscall) Handling:**
- Implements interrupts and system-level operations such as process management using supervisor calls.
  
### **3. Paging Mechanism:**
- Simulates paging for memory management, translating logical addresses to physical addresses.

### **4. Error Handling:**
- Includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that system errors are properly addressed and logged.

### **5. Interrupt Generation:**
- Simulates real-time event handling by generating interrupts to simulate real-time processing in an operating system.
  
### **6. Process Control Structures:**
- Implements data structures to control and manage multiple processes running in the simulated environment.

## Concepts Covered
